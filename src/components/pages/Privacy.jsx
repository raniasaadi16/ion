                Visiting our website <br/>
                When you visit our website, i.e. if you do not register or otherwise provide us with information, we only collect the personal data that your br/owser transmits to our server. If you wish to view our website, we collect the following data, which is technically necessary for us to display our website to you and to ensure stability and security:
                – IP address and service provider <br/>

                – Contents of the request (concrete page) <br/>

                – Br/owser incl. language and software version <br/>
                – Operating system and its interface <br/>
                The data listed in paragraph 1 are also automatically stored in the log files (log file) of our server. The log data is stored separately from other data and can only be viewed by the hoster. The storage period of the log data is 7 days.

The session cookies are deleted when you log out or close your br/owser. <br/>
            •    Persistent cookies are automatically deleted after a specified period, which may vary depending on the cookie. You can delete cookies at any time in the security settings of your br/owser. <br/>

                •    We also operate online presences (fanpages) within social networks and platforms. We present ourselves as a company, can communicate with you as our customers, partners or interested parties and publish information and offers. Also a possible analysis of the activity on our fan page can be done with statistical data, which is provided to us by the providers of social networks and platforms (so-called Insights data). However, data processing only takes place as soon as you interact with our fan page. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f DS-GVO, since data processing is carried out on the basis of our legitimate interests in more effective information and communication with you. Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b DS-GVO represents the legal basis for contract-relevant communication with us.<br/>
            •    When calling up and using our fan page, your personal data is processed by the providers of social networks and platforms themselves for analysis and advertising purposes. As the operator of the fan page, we have no influence on this and we do not receive any information from the respective providers about the exact scope of data processing. This allows the providers to create user profiles, e.g. to place advertisements in line with their interests. Cookies are usually stored on your devices for this purpose. Data processing can also take place outside the European Union. The US providers of social networks and platforms are certified according to the Privacy Shield, whereby they undertake to comply with the data protection standards of the EU (https://www.privacyshield.gov/list). The provider of the social networks and platforms is primarily responsible for data processing via the fan page. You also have the option of asserting your rights (see “No. [insert reference] your rights”) directly against the providers of social networks and platforms.<br/>

Insofar as the service providers are located in the USA, it is ensured that the providers are subject to the EU-US Privacy Shield Agreement and that an appropriate level of data protection can therefore be guaranteed (https://www.privacyshield.gov/list).
